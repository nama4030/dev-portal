My name is Napass (Ben) Masathienvong. I am an international student from Bangkok, Thailand.
I am interested in photography and cars. I will be graduating this semester!

<p>
I have taken Web class before. It has been a while since I have coded and so I will need to brush up my knowledge and skills.
I am interested in the aspect of UX/UI design in web technologies
</p>

I hope to learn new and interesting ways to present web pages! The parallax scrolling is one of the things that I am interested to try.
